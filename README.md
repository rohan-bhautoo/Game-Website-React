The game website was developed using vite with React which uses a faster and more efficient build system and provides a faster and more efficient development server. The website UI was cloned from the website [rawg.io](https://rawg.io/) which also provides a list of APIs for the website. Users are able to search games by name or genre or platform, filter the games with different options and also switch from dark/light mode.
